# Variables

# Variables are like containers for storing values.
# Values in the variables can be changed.


age = 10 # The following is the syntax for assigning an integer value 10 to a variable age


# Values

# Consider that variables are like containers for storing information.
# In context of programming, this information is often referred to as value.


# Data Type

# In programming languages, every value or data has an associated type to it known as data type.
# Some commonly used data types

# 1) String
# 2) Integer
# 3) Float
# 4) Boolean
# 5) This data type determines how the value or data can be used in the program. For example, mathematical operations can be done on Integer and Float types of data.

# 1) String

    # A String is a stream of characters enclosed within quotes.
    # Stream of Characters

        # Capital Letters ( A – Z )
        # Small Letters ( a – z )
        # Digits ( 0 – 9 )
        # Special Characters (~ ! @ # $ % ^ . ?,)
        # Space
        # Some Examples

        # "Hello World!"
        # "some@example.com"
        # "1234"

         
# 2) Integer


# All whole numbers (positive, negative and zero) without any fractional part come under Integers.
# Examples

    # ...-3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3,...

# 3) Float

    # Any number with a decimal point
    # 24.3, 345.210, -321.86

# 4) Boolean

    # In a general sense, anything that can take one of two possible values is considered a Boolean. Examples include the data that can take values like 

    # True or False
    # Yes or No
    # 0 or 1
    # On or Off, etc.
    # As per the Python Syntax, True and False are considered as Boolean values.
    # Notice that both start with a capital letter.

print(type(3))      #prints type of datatype "int"
print(type("3"))    #prints type of datatype "str"
print(type(2.5))    #prints type of datatype "float"
print(type(True))   #prints type of datatype "bool"
